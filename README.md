### This data analysis project is based on Kaggle Competition: 
https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/store-sales-time-series-forecasting/overview

All the datasets could be found from that project. Unzip the data into the subfolder "store-sales-time-series-forecasting". I will not post data in the repo because the size is not trivial.

### How to run the Notebook file ##
- Copy the folder and .jpynb to Colab to run the code from the Notebook.
- If your commputer is fast enough, run .jpynb locally in VSCode. You need to adjust the data_path accrordingly. The current data_path is designed to run in Colab.
